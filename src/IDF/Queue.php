/**
 * Queue system for the management of asynchronous operations.
 *
 * Anybody can add an item to the queue and any application can
 * register itself to process an item from the queue.
 *
 * An item in the queue is considered as fully processed when all the
 * handlers have processed it successfully.
 *
 * To push a new item in the queue:
 *
 * <code>
 * $item = new IDF_Queue();
 * $item->type = 'new_commit';
 * $item->payload = array('what', 'ever', array('data'));
 * $item->create();
 * </code>
 *
 * To process one item from the queue, you first need to register an
 * handler, by adding the following in your relations.php file before
 * the return statement or in your config file.
 *
 * <code>
 * Pluf_Signal::connect('IDF_Queue::processItem', 
 *                       array('YourApp_Class', 'processItem'));
 * </code>
 *
 * The processItem method will be called with two arguments, the first
 * is the name of the signal ('IDF_Queue::processItem') and the second
 * is an array with:
 *
 * <code>
 * array('item' => $item,
 *       'res' => array('OtherApp_Class::handler' => false,
 *                      'FooApp_Class::processItem' => true));
 * </code>
 *
 * When you process an item, you need first to check if the type is
 * corresponding to what you want to work with, then you need to check
 * in 'res' if you have not already processed successfully the item,
 * that is the key 'YourApp_Class::processItem' must be set to true,
 * and then you can process the item. At the end of your processing,
 * you need to modify by reference the 'res' key to add your status.
 *
 * All the data except for the type is in the payload, this makes the
 * queue flexible to manage many different kind of tasks.
