/**
 * This class is a plugin which allows to synchronise access riths
 * between InDefero and a common restricted SSH account for git
 * access.
 *
 * As the authentication is directly performed by accessing the
 * InDefero database, we only need to synchronize the SSH keys. This
 * synchronization process can only be performed by a process running
 * under the git user as we need to write in
 * /home/git/.ssh/authorized_keys
 *
 * So, here, we are just creating a file informing that a sync needs
 * to be done. We connect this plugin to the IDF_Key::postSave signal.
