---- Load local hooks if they exist.
-- The way this is supposed to work is that hooks.d can contain symbolic
-- links to lua scripts.  These links MUST have the extension .lua
-- If the script needs some configuration, a corresponding file with
-- the extension .conf is the right spot.
----
-- First load the configuration of the hooks, if applicable
includedirpattern(get_confdir() .. "/hooks.d/","*.conf")
-- Then load the hooks themselves
includedirpattern(get_confdir() .. "/hooks.d/","*.lua")
